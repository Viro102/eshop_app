# Introduction

This is a full-stack e-commerce web app, utilizing ReactJS FE and ExpressJS BE with MariaDB

This app follows **MVC** and **SPA** architecture, which means delegating routing and rendering to client-side and only using backend as an API for fetching data. The whole app is containerized in docker.
